The pseudo elements before and after allow you to add extra stylings to your web pages without adding extra mark up. Everything's done using CSS.
You must use the content property which is set to none by default.

Misconceptions: 
1. That the content is literally added before/after the element(against which the pseudo elements are added) in the DOM.
Explanation - The content "IS" part of the element against which the pseudo elements are added.

Points to remember:
1. To write the before/after for an element, for ex: the paragraph element <p>, you could do it as follows:
   p::before {
    your CSS goes here
   }
   p::after {
    your CSS goes here
   }
2. Notice the '::', this is the CSS3 standard for using the pseudo elements. ':' is used for pseudo class.
3. Pseudo elements will not work on images. However your content for a pseudo element could contain and image. content: 'url(image)';

Advantages:
1. You don't really have to add div elements only for designing. Instead you could use the pseudo elements before and after.

Using the content property:
1. To display an image before/after the element.
   Ex: p::before {
        content: 'image';
       }
2. To display quotes.
   Ex: p::before {
        content: 'open-quote'
       }
       p::after {
        content: 'close-quote'
       }
