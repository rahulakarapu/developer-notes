SASS (SCSS) variables store color properties so they can be used later on.
Also, to give you a basic concept, SASS is a CSS pre-processor which allows you to nest selectors, use mixins, store values on variables, etc.

Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet.
You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse.

Sass uses the $ symbol to make something a variable. Here's an example:

$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}
